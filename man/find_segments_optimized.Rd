\title{Optimized Segment Finding with Vectorized Operations}
\usage{
find_segments_optimized(mat, cliques, cut.off = 1, progress = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{Weight matrix from weight.matrix()}

\item{cliques}{List of cliques from igraph}

\item{cut.off}{Minimum weight threshold}

\item{progress}{Show progress bar}
}
\value{
List with membership and cliques
}
\description{
High-performance implementation of the segment finding algorithm using:
- Pre-sorted edges for single-pass processing
- Union-find for O(alpha(n)) group merging
- Vectorized clique membership testing
- Optional sparse matrix support
