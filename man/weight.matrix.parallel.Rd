\title{Parallel Weight Matrix Calculation}
\usage{
weight.matrix.parallel(
  mx,
  cut.off = 1,
  symmetric = TRUE,
  diagonal = NULL,
  small.cell.reduction = 0,
  n.cores = NULL,
  chunk.size = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mx}{A mobility table (square matrix) with row and column totals in the 
last row/column.}

\item{cut.off}{Numeric threshold for minimum relative risk. Values below this
are set to NA. Default is 1.}

\item{symmetric}{Logical indicating whether to force the matrix to be symmetric
by adding it to its transpose. Default is TRUE.}

\item{diagonal}{Controls diagonal values. If NULL (default), diagonal is set 
to NA. Otherwise, diagonal values are preserved.}

\item{small.cell.reduction}{Numeric value for handling small cells. Cells with
counts below this threshold are set to 0 before calculating relative risks.
Default is 0.}

\item{n.cores}{Number of cores to use}

\item{chunk.size}{Size of chunks for parallel processing}
}
\value{
Weight matrix with relative risks
}
\description{
Parallel version of weight.matrix() that uses multiple cores for computation.
