\arguments{
\item{mx}{Mobility matrix to analyze. Must be a square numeric matrix.}

\item{scr_range}{Numeric vector of length 2 specifying the range for 
small.cell.reduction parameter. Default is c(0, NULL) where NULL 
auto-determines the upper bound. Ignored if scr_values is provided.}

\item{cutoff_range}{Numeric vector of length 2 specifying the range for 
cut.off parameter. Default is c(0.5, 3). Ignored if cutoff_values is provided.}

\item{scr_values}{Numeric vector of custom small.cell.reduction values to test.
If provided, overrides scr_range and n_grid_points for SCR dimension.
Values must be non-negative and will be converted to integers. Allows
for targeted testing of specific parameter values based on prior knowledge
or domain expertise. Default is NULL.}

\item{cutoff_values}{Numeric vector of custom cut.off values to test.
If provided, overrides cutoff_range and n_grid_points for cutoff dimension.
Values must be positive. Enables focused evaluation of specific threshold
values identified through previous analysis. Default is NULL.}

\item{n_bootstrap}{Integer number of bootstrap samples for stability 
assessment. Default is 50. Higher values improve stability estimation
accuracy but increase computation time.}

\item{objectives}{Character vector of optimization objectives. Options include:
"stability", "quality", "sparsity", "modularity". 
Default is c("stability", "quality"). Multiple objectives are
combined using weighted aggregation.}

\item{weights}{Numeric vector of weights for combining multiple objectives.
Must sum to 1. Default is equal weights. Allows prioritization of
specific clustering properties in the optimization.}

\item{verbose}{Logical indicating whether to show detailed progress information.
Default is TRUE. When enabled, displays real-time progress tracking with
ETA estimation, parameter evaluation updates, and performance statistics.
Progress tracking works seamlessly with both sequential and parallel execution.}

\item{parallel}{Character or logical indicating parallel processing preference.
Can be "auto" (default, intelligent switching), TRUE/FALSE (force parallel/sequential),
or "parallel"/"sequential" for explicit control. When "auto", the function
analyzes problem characteristics and system resources to make optimal decision.
Progress tracking is maintained across all parallel workers.
\strong{Method-specific behavior:}
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Grid search}: Can parallelize across parameter combinations
  \item \strong{Adaptive}: Can parallelize within each refinement phase  
  \item \strong{Bayesian}: Uses sequential evaluation regardless of this setting
    due to mathematical dependencies between evaluations. Individual evaluations
    may use internal parallelization if available.
}}

\item{bayesian_iterations}{Integer number of Bayesian optimization iterations.}

\item{acquisition_function}{Character string specifying acquisition function:
"ei" (Expected Improvement) or "ucb" (Upper Confidence Bound).}

\item{exploration_factor}{Numeric exploration parameter for acquisition function.}

\item{n_initial}{Integer number of random initial points.}
