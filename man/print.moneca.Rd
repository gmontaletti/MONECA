\title{Print Method for MONECA Objects}
\usage{
\method{print}{moneca}(x, small.cell.reduction = x$small.cell.reduction, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A MONECA object returned by \code{\link{moneca}}.}

\item{small.cell.reduction}{Numeric threshold for small cell handling. If NULL,
uses the value from the MONECA object.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns a list of descriptive statistics, but primarily called
  for its side effect of printing a formatted summary.
}
\description{
Provides a comprehensive summary of MONECA analysis results including mobility
statistics, network properties, and segmentation quality measures across all
hierarchical levels.
}
\details{
The print method calculates and displays several key statistics:

\strong{Mobility Statistics:}
\itemize{
  \item Total mobility rate (proportion of off-diagonal movement)
  \item Diagonal mobility (immobility) by level
  \item Mobility captured by significant edges
}

\strong{Network Properties:}
\itemize{
  \item Node degrees (in, out, total) by level
  \item Network density by level
  \item Number of isolated nodes
  \item Edge weight distributions
}

\strong{Segmentation Quality:}
\itemize{
  \item Number of segments per level
  \item Proportion of mobility within vs. between segments
  \item Network coherence measures
}
}
\examples{
# Generate data and run analysis
mobility_data <- generate_mobility_data(n_classes = 6, seed = 42)
seg <- moneca(mobility_data, segment.levels = 3)

# Print comprehensive summary
print(seg)

# The summary includes mobility rates, network statistics, and
# segmentation quality measures for each hierarchical level
