\title{Print Method for MONECA Objects (Enhanced)}
\usage{
\method{print}{moneca}(
  x,
  small.cell.reduction = x$small.cell.reduction,

  digits = 1,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A MONECA object returned by \code{\link{moneca}}.}

\item{small.cell.reduction}{Numeric threshold for small cell handling. If NULL,
uses the value from the MONECA object.}

\item{show.degree.stats}{Logical. If TRUE (default), displays detailed degree 
distribution statistics for each hierarchical level.}

\item{digits}{Integer. Number of decimal places for numeric output (default 1).}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused).}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns NULL. This function is called for its side effect of
  printing a formatted summary.

\description{
Displays comprehensive mobility analysis results from MONECA clustering with
clear, interpretable statistics and improved labeling. Output is structured to
follow the natural flow of analysis from overall patterns to detailed metrics.
}
\details{
The output is organized into four main sections that follow the analysis workflow:

\strong{Section 1: OVERALL MOBILITY PATTERNS}
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Overall Population Mobility Rate}: Percentage of the total 
    population that experiences any form of mobility (moves from origin to a
    different destination). Calculated as: (total off-diagonal cells) / (grand total).
    A rate of 20% means 80% remain in their origin position.
  \item \strong{Average Mobility Concentration}: Mean percentage of mobility
    captured by significant pathways (edges with relative risk > 1) across all
    segmentation levels. Higher values indicate mobility is concentrated in
    fewer, stronger pathways rather than dispersed randomly.
}

\strong{Section 2: HIERARCHICAL SEGMENTATION ANALYSIS}

\emph{Internal Mobility Within Segments (percent):}
\itemize{
  \item Shows the percentage of mobility that remains within segment boundaries
    at each level. Level 1 represents original categories (always 100% as each
    category is its own segment). Higher levels show increasing aggregation.
  \item Values decrease at higher levels as segments combine different origin
    categories, naturally reducing internal cohesion.
  \item High values (>70%) indicate segments successfully capture mobility patterns.
}

\emph{Mobility Concentration in Significant Pathways by Level (percent):}
\itemize{
  \item Percentage of total mobility flowing through edges with relative risk > 1.
  \item Indicates how much mobility follows stronger-than-expected pathways
    versus random distribution.
  \item Higher values suggest clearer mobility structure; lower values indicate
    more dispersed patterns.
}

\emph{Network Structure by Level:}
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Active Segments/Classes}: Number of nodes in the network.
    Decreases at higher levels as categories aggregate into segments.
  \item \strong{Significant Edges}: Count of mobility pathways with relative
    risk > 1. These represent stronger-than-expected mobility connections.
  \item \strong{Network Density}: Proportion of possible edges that exist.
    Calculated as: (actual edges) / (possible edges). Range 0-1.
  \item \strong{Isolated Segments}: Number of segments with no significant
    connections to other segments. Isolates represent positions that exchange
    members primarily internally or have only weak external connections.
}

\strong{Section 3: DETAILED WEIGHTED DEGREE DISTRIBUTIONS (optional)}

Shows distribution statistics (Min, Q1, Median, Mean, Q3, Max) for:
\itemize{
  \item \strong{Total Weighted Connections}: Sum of weighted incoming and outgoing 
    connections (strength) for each node. Represents the total volume of mobility
    flows, not just the count of connections.
  \item \strong{Outward Mobility Strength}: Sum of weights on outgoing edges from
    each origin. High out-strength indicates positions that send large volumes
    to other destinations, weighted by relative risk.
  \item \strong{Inward Mobility Strength}: Sum of weights on incoming edges to
    each destination. High in-strength indicates positions that receive large
    volumes from other origins, weighted by relative risk.
  \item \strong{Edge Weight Distribution}: Distribution of relative risk values
    for significant edges. Values > 1 indicate mobility above expected levels.
    Higher values represent stronger mobility pathways.
}
}
\section{Technical Terms}{

\describe{
  \item{\strong{Isolate}}{A node (category or segment) with no significant 
    connections to other nodes. In mobility analysis, isolates represent 
    positions that either have very high internal retention or only weak
    exchange with other positions. Not necessarily problematic - may indicate
    genuinely distinct positions.}
  \item{\strong{Relative Risk}}{Ratio of observed to expected mobility under
    independence. Values > 1 indicate mobility exceeds random expectation;
    < 1 indicates below expectation. Used as edge weights in the network.}
  \item{\strong{Network Density}}{Proportion of all possible connections that
    actually exist. In a fully connected network (density = 1), every position
    has significant mobility to every other position. Low density indicates
    mobility is channeled through specific pathways.}
  \item{\strong{Degree/Strength}}{In weighted networks, we use \strong{strength} 
    instead of simple degree: the sum of edge weights connected to a node.
    In-strength = sum of incoming edge weights, out-strength = sum of outgoing
    edge weights, total strength = sum of both. High strength nodes handle large
    volumes of mobility flow, not just many connections.}
  \item{\strong{Segmentation Level}}{Hierarchical aggregation level. Level 1 =
    original categories, Level 2 = first aggregation based on cliques, etc.
    Higher levels represent coarser groupings.}
