\title{Evaluate Performance Trade-offs}
\usage{
evaluate_performance_trade_offs(
  quality_metrics,
  performance_metrics,
  performance_weight = 0.3
)
}
\arguments{
\item{quality_metrics}{List of quality metric results for each candidate.}

\item{performance_metrics}{List of performance metric results for each candidate.}

\item{performance_weight}{Numeric weight (0-1) for performance vs quality 
trade-off. Higher values prioritize speed over quality.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of trade-off scores for each candidate.
}
\description{
Balances clustering quality against computational performance to identify 
optimal parameters for different use cases and constraints.
}
\details{
The function combines normalized quality and performance scores using 
the specified weight. Quality scores include clustering metrics like 
modularity and silhouette coefficients. Performance scores consider 
computational time and memory efficiency.

# This function is typically called internally by auto_tune_small_cell_reduction
# Example usage in isolation:

quality_list <- list(
  list(overall = 0.8),
  list(overall = 0.6),
  list(overall = 0.9)
)

performance_list <- list(
  list(time = 1.2, valid = TRUE),
  list(time = 0.8, valid = TRUE), 
  list(time = 2.1, valid = TRUE)
)

trade_offs <- evaluate_performance_trade_offs(
  quality_metrics = quality_list,
  performance_metrics = performance_list,
  performance_weight = 0.3
)
}
