\title{Enhanced Segment Membership with Meaningful Names}
\usage{
segment.membership.enhanced(
  segments,
  level = seq(segments$segment.list),
  naming_strategy = "auto",
  custom_names = NULL,
  separator = " + ",
  max_concat_length = 2,
  pattern_rules = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{segments}{A MONECA object returned by \code{\link{moneca}}.}

\item{level}{Integer vector specifying which hierarchical levels to include.
Default includes all available levels.}

\item{naming_strategy}{Character string specifying the naming approach:
\itemize{
  \item "auto" (default): Automatic naming based on segment composition
  \item "concat": Concatenate node names with separator
  \item "pattern": Use pattern recognition for common suffixes/prefixes
  \item "custom": Use user-provided names from custom_names parameter
}}

\item{custom_names}{Named list providing custom names for specific segments.
Format: list("level.segment" = "Custom Name"), e.g., list("2.1" = "Blue Collar")}

\item{separator}{Character string used to separate names when concatenating.
Default is " + ".}

\item{max_concat_length}{Maximum number of names to concatenate before 
switching to pattern-based naming. Default is 2.}

\item{pattern_rules}{Named list of pattern rules for automatic naming.
Default includes common patterns like "Worker" → "Workers_Group".}
}
\value{
A data frame with three columns:
  \describe{
    \item{name}{Character vector of original category names}
    \item{membership}{Character vector indicating segment membership, formatted
      as "level.segment" (e.g., "2.1" for level 2, segment 1)}
    \item{level_name}{Character vector with meaningful segment names derived
      from constituent nodes or user-provided names}
  }
}
\description{
Returns segment membership information with an additional column containing 
meaningful segment names derived from the constituent nodes. This function 
extends \code{\link{segment.membership}} by adding intelligent naming 
strategies for aggregated segments.
}
\details{
The function applies different naming strategies based on segment composition:
\enumerate{
  \item \strong{Individual nodes}: Keep original name unchanged
  \item \strong{Small segments} (≤ max_concat_length): Concatenate names
  \item \strong{Large segments}: Apply pattern recognition or use generic names
  \item \strong{Custom names}: Override automatic naming with user-provided names
}

Pattern recognition identifies common suffixes (e.g., "Worker", "Manager") 
and creates group names (e.g., "Workers_Group", "Management_Group").

# Generate data and run analysis
mob_data <- generate_mobility_data(n_classes = 6, seed = 42,
  class_names = c("Upper_Class", "Professional", "Manager", 
                  "Skilled_Worker", "Service_Worker", "Manual_Worker"))
seg <- moneca(mob_data, segment.levels = 3)

# Get enhanced membership with automatic naming
enhanced <- segment.membership.enhanced(seg)
print(enhanced)

# Use concatenation strategy
concat_membership <- segment.membership.enhanced(seg, 
                                                naming_strategy = "concat")

# Use custom names for specific segments
custom_names <- list("2.1" = "Blue_Collar", "3.1" = "All_Classes")
custom_membership <- segment.membership.enhanced(seg, 
                                                naming_strategy = "custom",
                                                custom_names = custom_names)
