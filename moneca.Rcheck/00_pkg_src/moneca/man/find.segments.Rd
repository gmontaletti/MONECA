\title{Find Segments in Mobility Networks}
\usage{
find.segments(
  mat,
  cliques,
  cut.off = 1,
  mode = "symmetric",
  delete.upper.tri = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{A weighted adjacency matrix representing mobility flows or relationships.
Should include row and column names representing the categories/classes.}

\item{cliques}{A list of cliques (complete subgraphs) in the network, typically
obtained from \code{igraph::cliques()}.}

\item{cut.off}{Numeric threshold for minimum weight or relative risk to be
considered a network tie. Default is 1.}

\item{mode}{Character string specifying how to handle asymmetric relationships:
\itemize{
  \item "symmetric" (default): Standard symmetric treatment
  \item "Mutual": Only mutual ties (bidirectional) are considered
  \item "Unmutual": Unidirectional ties are allowed
}}

\item{delete.upper.tri}{Logical indicating whether to process only the lower
triangle of the matrix for efficiency. Default is TRUE.}
}
\value{
A list with two components:
  \describe{
    \item{membership}{A factor indicating segment membership for each node}
    \item{cliques}{A list where each element contains the indices of nodes
      belonging to that segment}
  }
}
\description{
Identifies discrete groups or segments based on a weighted network matrix using a
clique-based algorithm. This function implements the core segmentation algorithm
that iteratively assigns nodes to segments based on network ties.
}
\details{
The algorithm works by iteratively examining the strongest remaining ties in the
network and assigning nodes to segments based on clique membership. It uses a
greedy approach that prioritizes stronger connections and larger existing segments.
